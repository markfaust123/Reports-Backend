TODO: Task 7 (User Authentication)
TODO: Only allow creation of account if given appropriate access (Ex: need to provide account creation code or can only be valid jhed or use Outlook Oauth)
TODO: Only allow access to resources if have valid JWT token (move @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard) to above the controllers)
TODO: Allow for search across title AND description
TODO: Search + Pagination does not always work. EX: make 12 reports, with 1 - 12 in the title, respectively. then, search for '8' with pagintion limit = 4 and offset = 1. 
TODO: Create example.env file for setup

Thoughts:
* Create one-to-one relationship with user and their profiles, as suggested in Task 8
* Implement a many-to-many relationship for "reposting" reports (multiple people working on the same report?)

Errors: 

* Creation of two users with the same name will just return a "500: Internal server error." No user is created in the database, but the user id (primary key) is nonetheless incremented. We should probably make sure that a more specific error is thrown and that the user id is not incremented. (try making user with same username and then read the console logs ERROR)
